Mental Health Prediction App

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts a user's mental health condition using machine learning. The app takes user input, preprocesses the data, and runs it through a trained deep learning model to classify whether the person is mentally healthy or might need support.

Features

🧠 Predicts mental health status (Yes / No)

📊 Uses TensorFlow + Scikit-learn for model training and prediction

🌐 Interactive Streamlit dashboard for easy usage

📥 Allows CSV file upload for batch predictions

📄 Option to download requirements.txt for deployment

Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit (for UI)

TensorFlow / Keras (for ML model)

Scikit-learn (for preprocessing & encoding)

Pandas / NumPy (for data handling)

## How to Run  

Clone the repository:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-prediction.git  
cd mental-health-prediction  

pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
